List of Assumptions 

Pitching:
- When the pitcher throws to a zone, he throws to the center of that zone
- Two-Seam and Sinkers are the same pitch
- Pitchers' accuracy is independent of state (i.e. count, outs, runners are base are irrelevant to accuracy)
- We have information on spin rates, but we assume spin rate does not effect the outcome transition probabilities

Hitting:
- We ignore all pitches in which the batter gets hit by a pitch

Obvious Zones:
- We create our Obvious Zone Cutoffs based on Righty and Lefty Batters. It might make more sense to partition 
the data set, then create our obvious zones, because righty and lefty batters may have different swing
tendencies and therefore have different obvious zones.
